# Show Link Blank Page

# What's this addon for?

It shows a little information box if you hover over an <a>-link which contains the target _blank

# Why???

Just a little experiment for myself to test the firefox extension api and just idk :D
Feel free to contribute

# Where can i find this crab?

Weirdly the firefox team accepted my first attempt to publish this addon on their extensions marketplace
